# How to Set Up D3.js with Webpack and Babel

This repository accompanies my [tutorial](https://medium.com/code-like-a-girl/how-to-set-up-d3-js-with-webpack-and-babel-7bd3f5e20df7#.dv1hfry3g) on Medium. Follow along!   

Before you begin, make sure you have node and npm installed. Use a node version higher than 6. Also, note that all terminal commands are for Mac. Please use the equivalent commands for your OS.

The other day I was setting up a D3.js project when I ran into the classic developer conundrum — if I wanted to set up the project without using a CDN, I’d need to learn a couple of other auxiliary technologies. I had been meaning to learn to use webpack anyways, so I was happy to find a reason to get a jump on it. I didn’t find an existing tutorial for these three technologies, so thought I would share how I set up my project with you!

Here we go!
